  {topic} is a common condition among civilians in today’s society. So,
  {topic} has become increasingly evident among teens according to many scientists.
  now, solving {topic} is becoming a more and more significant issue.
  we have to face an embarrassing situation, that is,
  what should we do to give rise to {topic}, and what should we do to prevent {topic}'s happening.
  but these are not the most urgent issue. A more pressing issue about {topic} is,
  what could we do anyway to achieve {topic}.
  with these questions, let's take a closer look at {topic}.
  for {topic}, the key point is how to express {topic}.
  we generally say, if we grasped the key of the problem of {topic}, everthing else will be easily solved.
  what is the key point of {topic}?
  why does {topic} happen?
  every person has to face these problems caused by {topic}. When facing these problems,
  we must think carefully when talking about {topic}.
  we have to figure out what kind of existence {topic} is.
  for many years, people with {topic} have been viewed as different.
  the problem lies in the difference of people raised by {topic}.
  does the government provide help for {topic}?
  as this subject continues to be looked down upon, people must realize that {topic} are becoming more common in today’s world.
  more current studies of people who take {topic} heavily show no evidence of emotional damage.
  several studies of the effects of {topic} on the human systems have failed to demonstrate these effects.
  one of the longest standing arguments against the use of {topic} is that,
  modern vehement arguments against {topic} alone become suspect.
  {topic} continues to be a relevant controversial issue in society today, as
  from my point of view, {topic} means a lot to me, and
  we have been thinking about {topic} for a long time.
  what if {topic} happens, and what if {topic} does not happen.
  when facing this difficult choice of {topic}, I rarely sleep well.
  if {topic} takes place in our daliy life, we have to consider its consequences.
  the consequece of {topic} is of great significance to me, and to many other people.
  if we think about it from a different point of view,
  it is inevitable.
  under this inevitable circumstance, we have to solve {topic}.
  under this inevitable situation, we have to solve {topic}.
  for me, the emergent rise of {topic} may have changed my life.
  opponents of {topic} claim that,
  some people may disagree with {topic}.
  to a certain extent, {topic} is right.
  after seeing this evidence, there is no way we can agree with {topic}.
  the evidence presented in this assignment has shown that,
  in my opinion,
  in general,
  as far as I know,

  furthermore,

  in addition,
  besides,
  above all,
  similarly,
  with respect to,
  since that is so,
  thus,
  therefore,
  in that case,
  in other words,
  it is important to note that,
  on the other hand,
  on one hand,
contrasts: |
  by contrast,
  another way of viewing this is,
  alternatively,
  another possibility is,
  in comparison,
  on the contrary,
  in fact,
  to look at it in another way,
  it is disappointing that,
  however,

  that is to say,
  for example,
  for instance,
  namely,
  as in the following example,

  That inspired me.
  That aroused my imagination.
  That solved my problem.
  Which brought a new way of thinking it.

saying: |
  the flame that burns Twice as bright burns half as long.
  there is truth in wine and children.
  that which yields is not always weak.
  if you want a thing done well, do it yourself.
  necessity is the mother of invention.
  all human beings should try to learn before they die what they are running from, and to, and why.
  melancholy: an appetite no misery satisfies.
  it's only words... unless they're true.
  plants are more courageous than almost all human beings: an orange tree would rather die than produce lemons, whereas instead of dying the average person would rather be someone they are not.
  if a man has his eyes bound, you can encourage him as much as you like to stare through the bandage, but he'll never see anything.
  never trust a computer you can't throw out a window.
  I have forgotten my umbrella.
  The trouble about man is twofold. He cannot learn truths which are too complicated; he forgets truths which are too simple.
  the shortest distance between two points is always under construction.
  some people talk about other people’s failures with so much pleasure that you would swear they are talking about their own successes.
  there is music you never hear unless you play it yourself.
  what you choose also chooses you.
  all Excess is ill: But Drunkenness is of the worst Sort. It spoils Health, dismounts the Mind, and unmans Men: It reveals Secrets, is Quarrelsome, Lascivious, Impudent, Dangerous and Mad. In fine, he that is drunk is not a Man: Because he is so long void of Reason, that distinguishes a Man from a Beast.
  an aphorism ought to be entirely isolated from the surrounding world like a little work of art and complete in itself like a hedgehog.
  laughter is the antidote to existential pain.
  Eko brushed a tear from her eye, and Immo jeered at her, but father held up a hand. "Never mock a tender heart," he said.
  smile and the world will laugh at you.
  we say sound things when we do not strive to say to say extraordinary ones.
